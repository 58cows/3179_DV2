Description

This project explores how household income, poverty rates, and population distribution differ across Malaysia.
By combining official Department of Statistics Malaysia (DOSM) datasets and spatial boundaries, the visualisations reveal patterns of inequality between states, highlighting relationships between income levels and poverty incidence.
Built entirely in Vega-Lite, hosted on GitHub Pages, and optimised (< 1 MB total data) for public viewing.
